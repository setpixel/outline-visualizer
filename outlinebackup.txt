Classroom teacher handing out grades 
  In a hot classroom on the last day of school, a teacher is passing out final papers to students. All the kids are watching the clock (2:57) as the second hand slowly ticks. The teacher stops at Ryan's empty desk, and gives Ryan's paper to Malcolm, a 13 year old, short chubby nerdy kid. Bell rings.

Ryan forced out of the tunnel by workers  
  Back in the underground tunnel, Ryan carefully opens the chest. To his disappointment, there is nothing but a small button. While closing the chest, he loses his grip and the lid slams shut making a noise and alerting some MTA workers. Ryan gets chased. While escaping, Ryan notices an open door he's never seen before. He wants to stay and explore what's through the door, but he has to run. He narrowly escapes.

Ryan talks with Mr. Oliver 
  Ryan walks slowly through the dimly lit antique shop, filled with beautiful old objects. It looks like a museum. There are half-full packing boxes as Ryan walks to the back of the shop. In the back, Mr. Oliver, a weathered, bald, mustached, 75 year old man, tells Ryan a touching story about an object. At the end of the beautiful story, Mr. Oliver throws the object away. Ryan is horrified. To change the mood, Ryan shows Mr. Oliver the button he found in the tunnels. Mr. Oliver perks up. Mr. Oliver reviews an old scrapbook he compiled about a disappeared rich old Tycoon, revealing that the button is that of a liveried servant working for the Tycoon in the 1920s. Ryan is excited about this new discovery. Ryan says, "Do you think it's down there?" Mr. Oliver says, "I know it is. But even if you found it, how would you get in?" Late to get home, Ryan hurriedly tries to copy some maps in the scrapbook. Mr. Oliver just gives him the scrapbook. Ryan is incredibly thankful. Ryan straps the giant scrapbook to the back of his backpack. Ryan leaves in a hurry to get home before his mom gets home, and promises to help Mr. Oliver move next day before he leaves.

Ryan stops at skate park to show Malcolm
  Ryan arrives at a busy skate park under the Manhattan Bridge. Skaters are doing tricks and socializing. From outside of the park, Ryan scans, looking for his friend Malcolm. A girl new to the park, Mikayla, 17, is interviewing people and taking pictures. Ryan spots Malcolm hanging out with some cool kids. Malcolm sees Ryan outside of the park, and kind of acknowledges him, but mostly ignores him. A group of Bikers approach Ryan from behind, teasing him about the huge scrapbook attached to his backpack.

Fight 
  Just outside of the skate park, Ryan is surrounded by 7 bikers. The surly Alpha Biker, 17, grabs the book off of Ryan's backpack and starts looking through it. Ryan grabs for the book. Alpha biker jerks it back, and rips some pages out. Ryan grabs for the book. Ryan calls the Alpha biker an "Asshole." Alpha biker pushes Ryan down and kicks him. Alpha biker instructs other biker, Vince to join. Vince, a large 6'5", 17 year old approaches. Everyone in the skate park takes notice. Out of nowhere, Jordan, 17 year old muscular skater, steps in and hits Alpha biker. Taken aback, and with all of the skaters behind Jordan, the fight is diffused. Bikers vow revenge and leave. Jordan leans down over Ryan as to help him up, but instead, slaps Ryan on the side of the head. Jordan walks away, annoyed. Malcolm comes and helps Ryan up, picking up the scattered pages, embarrassed, as the entire skate park looks on.

Walk through apartment building
  They walk into their run-down apartment building. The elevator door is opened, but filled with trash and obviously out of order. They walk up the stairs walking around a passed out vagrant in the unlit stairway. They walk through the hallway, passing half opened doors, empty apartments, arriving at a closed door. Ryan slowly inserts a key and opens the door.

In room, Ryan illustrates his want
  Ryan's room is a chaotic mess filled with found objects, maps, various junk, and half filled boxes. Ryan starts going through the scrapbook, excited about what's inside. Malcolm gives him his paper, asking what he thinks about going to his new school next year. Ryan uninterested, focused on the book. Malcolm says he was invited to play kickball with Chris, the cool kids, later, and he's sure it would be OK if Ryan came too. Ryan is annoyed at even the suggestion of hanging out with the cool kids. Ryan shows Malcolm his newly acquired map. Ryan explains that he's looking for the fabled Tycoon's underground vault. Malcolm is doubtful. Malcolm says, "Look. If all these people have been looking for this thing, how are, YOU, going to find it?" Ryan says impassioned, "I don't know. But everyone else just gave up. I need to find this. I'm looking for a key." Malcolm starts to turn. Ryan says, "It's our last weekend together." Malcolm agrees to go.

  Ryan and Malcolm try to sneak out through the hallway. Mom stops them, "You're not going anywhere. Did you even finish packing your room? I got a call from school today - do you know what it's about?" Ryan is stunned, "Mom. It's Friday night." Mom sighs, "I know. You can hang out with your friends tomorrow after packing is done, OK?" Ryan disappointed, "OK." Malcolm slips out the door.

The older biker, Jordan says, "Shouldn't you be at home helping Mom?" Jordan is Ryan's brother. Ryan is pissed. Ryan flips out and confronts his brother. Jordan is smirking. Ryan says something cutting. Jordan stands up looking concerned into the distance. Malcolm approaches with Mikayla behind him observing.

Walk through to an abandoned subway station  
  Everyone is silent. Ryan guides them through a dark tunnel. Jordan says, "Hey. Where are we going?" Ryan says, "I know a way out." Jordan says, "It doesn't seem like it." They walk for a bit, and the tunnel opens to an old abandoned subway station. The ceilings are arched, and the tile work on the walls is intricate. No one else has seen anything like it before. Everyone sees the beauty, even if they don't fully respect it. Jordan and Vince are kicking old loose tiles off the walls. Ryan is annoyed. Ryan shows them the exit right up the steps, with the light of the street shining down. Jordan is mildly impressed. Even though the exit is right there, the other's seem interested in the space. Mikayla takes an interest in Ryan wondering how he knows about this space. Ryan explains a bit and turns on his black light, illuminating his fluorescent chalk markings. The markings are all over the place, and reveals a dark area with a door to a gigantic dark room. Jordan walks towards the door. Ryan is quick to say, "Don't go in there!" Jordan asks, "Why?" Ryan hears a distant boom. He touches the wall and leans down with his ear by the ground. Jordan, "You're so fucking weird." Jordan goes into the large dark room. Vince follows. Mikayla with Ryan looks cautious.

In the machine room 
  Ryan quickly walks to the door to the giant room and turns on a light on his backpack, lighting the room. The room is a gigantic tubular machine room. There are some vents on the ground and large old abandoned machines scattered around. Jordan says, "Whoa." It echoes. With the room shaped as a tube, it's an almost perfect pipe to skate in. Jordan drops his board and he skates the pipe, and does a trick off a platform edge. It's impressive. Vince asks to borrow Malcolm's board. Ryan warns, "You guys. It's not safe." But they are skating, and it's undeniably fun. Jordan makes a jump onto a platform, and it wobbles. He smiles. Malcolm grabs for Ryan's board to skate. Ryan grabs his board back, "Don't." Just as he says that, Vince's board clips a piece of wire and he is thrown into a wall, and falls onto some metal lattice, and falls through a hole in the grating. Silence. Vince calls out, "Fuck!" Vince is hanging on a ledge 6 feet below the opening. Below him is darkness. Everyone gathers around the hole, terrified. Vince's hands and side of his face are bloodied. For a moment no one says anything. Jordan says, "Maybe we should just leave him here." Vince says, "What? No." Ryan reaches into his bag and grabs a carabiner cable. He attaches it to the lattice. The lattice wobbles. Mikayla says, "We should go get help." "No! Please don't leave me here," Vince pleads. Malcolm says, "We can't leave him here you guys." Ryan casts the other end of the cable down and Vince starts grasping for it. Ryan tries to sway it his way. Everyone leans in. Mikayla says, "Guys. I'm going to go get help." Vince grabs the cable and hangs from it. SNAP. The lattice breaks from the weight of Vince, and everyone falls down the dark hole.

Stuck down there, no way back
  They swim to the other end of the sewage room to dry land, Jordan dragging Vince and pulling him up out of the water. Vince is hurt badly. His face and arm are bloody, and hitting the wall in the tube has busted his leg. Jordan looks back up at the hole they fell out of. There's no clear way back. Jordan tries to scale the wall, and swing the rope up to catch on something, but it is impossible. There is no way. Mikayla asks if everyone is OK. Everyone else seems to be fine. Jordan has a huge gash on his right shoulder. Jordan incredibly pissed that they are stuck and blames Ryan for taking them down there in the first place. Jordan brings up something from above ground that stings for Ryan. Ryan is withdrawn. Jordan grabs the flashlight from Ryan, "I'll figure a way out of here." To Vince, "Can you walk or are we leaving you here?" Vince gets up with a limp.

Jordan leads, others follow and talk

Mikayla gets people to open up a little
  Mikayla suggests that the group could move a little slower. Vince is hurt, limping, dragging his leg. Jordan says, "I don't give a fuck." Mikayla tries to change the mood. to vince: where are you from? learn about everyones aboveground lives. differences.

Jordan leads them in a circle
  Vince mentions that this area looks familiar. Everyone else agrees. Jordan says he's sure he knows what he's doing. Ryan says, "We've definitely been here before." Ryan turns on his black light illuminating all of his chalk markings. Jordan is wrong. Ryan look back and says he thinks he knows where to go. They walk for a bit, and walk through the door with the marking from Mr. Oliver's scrap book.
Ryan and Jordan walk and talk
  Ryan and Jordan stand on the platform through the doorway. This area is definitely different. Stairs lead down. Jordan, "You think the way down is the way out?" Ryan looks unsure, "I just have a feeling." Jordan hesitant. Jordan looks closely at Ryan. Mikayla grabs the flashlight out of Jordan's hand and just starts walking down the stairs, "Come on guys, we don't have any other way to go. These stairs must lead somewhere."
