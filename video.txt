Is a super simple outlining tool


Outline Visualizer turns a text outline in a visual display of the story automatically. 

You can simply write an outline in any text editor, and the visualizer shows you each scene in order, showing you the scene caption, descriptive text, and all of the other scenes in the form of a timeline with acccurate timing.

This allows you outline a story as quickly as you can write text.

Move quickly and change often.

Outline Visualizer is an extremely easy way to turn an text outline into a story you can step through.

You write your outline in simple text, using lines for each story idea, and tabs to include descriptions. You can also use sections.

Let's make an outline!

# ACT 1

Man wakes up
Man miserable with life
Man goes to work
Coworkers play a joke on man, man sad
Man assigned to work in group
Man meets girl
There is a connection
Man happy going home
Man happy coming to work
Girl has been transferred off project

# ACT 2

Coworkers play joke on man again, man mad
Man goes looking for girl

Why?

I'm trying to get a sense of how the story will feel as fast as possible

keep iterating


For the project we are working on, we go through and refine the synopeses for each scene as we iterate the story. We call it our outline. Other people might call it a treatment.
